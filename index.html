<!DOCTYPE html>
// using !tab we can create this doctype
<html lang="en">
  //every html starts with this
  <head>
    // whatever we put in the head is the setting of the page
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    //here we linked index.html file to style.css file using link attribute
    //usig style attribute we use CSS to style elements to create a layout for the overall page
    we can write CSS write here in the HTML file using the style element and that style element is not for visible content here on the page so it would go right here into the head because head is for settings of the page and style definitely counts as a setting. To style elements we need to first select them and there are different types of selectors in CSS but the most basic one is the element selector. with the element selector we can simply select all elements of a certain type. for eg body{} and inside curly braces we can write CSS declarations. so each CSS declaration has a property name and then a value here background-color is property and green is a value

    each id can be used once on the page while classes can be used over and over
